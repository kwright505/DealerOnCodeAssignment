Problem Two:

I went about solving this problem by splitting it up into three parts:
1. parsing through imput to get item name and price 
2. figuring out taxes based on the the type of item and if it is imported
3. combining prices and taxes and output reciept

Assumtions and Requirements:

1. the input is split by commas instead of new lines
2. food and medical supplies are found in the food.txt and medsupplies.txt files (can be changed and appended)
